# Hi, I'm Alireza 👋

I'm an Informatik student in Germany, focused on building a strong engineering foundation through learning, experimentation, and real projects.

## Focus
- Software Engineering fundamentals
- System thinking and problem solving
- Building and improving systems step by step
- Learning tools and technologies through practical use

## What you'll find here
- A small set of curated repositories representing my learning path
- Projects and experiments built with a focus on clarity and structure
- Continuous refinement as my understanding grows

## Goal
Develop a solid and flexible engineering base that allows me to design, build, and maintain reliable systems over the long term.

Thanks for visiting!
